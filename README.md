## ChatGuard
ChatGuard is a simple and secure app for end-to-end encrypted messaging on platforms like **Eitaa,
Bale, and Soroush**, working entirely without servers or accounts. All encryption keys are stored
locally on your device, and encrypted messages are disguised as normal text, keeping your chats
private and undetectable. Detailed information about how ChatGuard secures your messages can be
found in the [How it Works](HOW_WORKS.md) guide, and the latest versions of the app can be
downloaded [from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/amirroid/ChatGuard/releases).
