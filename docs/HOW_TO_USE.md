## Installing and Enabling Accessibility Service in ChatGuard

To unlock the full functionality of ChatGuard, you need to install the app and enable its **Accessibility Service**.

### Step 1: Installing from Unknown Sources
If your device blocks installation because the app is from an unknown source, follow these steps:
1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Apps & notifications** > **Special app access** > **Install unknown apps** (or similar).
3. Select the app you will use to install ChatGuard (e.g., file manager or browser).
4. Enable **Allow from this source**.
5. On some devices (especially newer Android versions), you may also need to enable **Allow Restricted Permissions** to fully permit installation.

### Step 2: Adjust Google Play Protect (if needed)
If the app shows security warnings during installation, temporarily disable **Google Play Protect**:
1. Open the **Google Play** app.
2. Go to **Play Protect** in the settings.
3. Temporarily disable scanning of apps.  
   You can re-enable it after the installation is complete.

### Step 3: Enabling Accessibility
1. Open ChatGuard and tap on **اعطای مجوز**.
2. In the settings page, navigate to **Downloaded apps** (or equivalent section).
3. Find **ChatGuard** and select it.
4. Enable **Use Service** or **Enable**.
5. Read the system warning and confirm by tapping **Allow** or **OK**.

After completing these steps, ChatGuard will have full access to its features and operate without limitations.
